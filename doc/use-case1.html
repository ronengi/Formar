    I want to open a file for editing in a new tab in an existing vim session.
I also want the newly opened tab to be located first, and in a folowing tab to
keep the existing session, which currently holds one opened editable file.

    I am totaly fludded with work. Clients and coleagues call repeatedly to
bother me with super urgent requests, and on top of all I am trying to learn
some other needed new stuff.

    As learning vim now is the last of my concerns, this thing with the tabs
needs to be done yesterday. 



    My wish is that with a single click, some sort of a knowledge base will
open. With the next click the requested subject of knowledge will emerge.
Then, and this is very important, with a glance I will know how to do what I
want. Then I want to go back to work, as undistracted as possible.

    For my with to come true, the following four things need to exist, in more
or less their presentation order of importance:

 1. There needs to be a knowledge base.
    It should reside in the cloud or network, in order to be shared amongst
    many users if it is cross organization, or many computers if it is to be
    easily accessible.

 2. In order to be viewed and understood as quickly as possible, information
    should contain some learning aids like: highlights, graphs, pictures,
    movies, usage examples.
    
 3. The information base also has to be effectively searchable. So it should
    use some sort of cross-item linking logic.

 4. It should be easilly editable, thus maintaining it is done effectively on
      the fly, during work EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
    Visually pleasant.



- easy learning curve
- repository manageable
- extra useful utilities - calculator, etc..
- interface to other tools\

- flat as possible learning curve
